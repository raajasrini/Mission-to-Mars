# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of Project
Robin's web app is looking good and functioning well, but she wants to add more polish to it. She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, you’ll use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

### Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter scraped full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres websites to get the titles of those images.
Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.ipynb file contains the process of visiting Mar's website , Mar's facts and scrapping of those images.

**Code and images:


### Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Using your Python and HTML skills, you’ll add the code you created in Deliverable 1 to your scraping.py file, update your Mongo database, and modify your index.html file so the webpage contains all the information you collected in this module as well as the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image

* The scraping.py file contains code that retrieves the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.
* The Mongo database is updated to contain the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.
* The index.html file contains code that will display the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.
* After the scraping has been completed, the web app contains all the information from this module and the full-resolution images and titles for the four hemisphere images.

**Results with detail analysis:**
 The scraping.py file contains code that retrieves the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.


### Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components
* The webpage is mobile-responsive.

* Two additional Bootstrap 3 components are used to style the webpage.
